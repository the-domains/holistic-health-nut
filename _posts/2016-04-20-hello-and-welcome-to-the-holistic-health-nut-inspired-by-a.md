**_Hello and welcome to the Holistic Health Nut, inspired by a healthy holistic approach to creating and enjoying life._**

I am Aurora and I am a certified Holistic Health and Wellness Coach and a self-confessed holistic health nut who is inspired by healthy living and helping others easily integrate more health and fun into their everyday lifestyle.

I am originally from Perth, Western Australia, however as a young adult I bought and one way ticket and my exploration of life and travel begun...  
I enjoyed many years living abroad, traveling and experiencing life, different cultures in different countries throughout the world from London to Dubai, Spain and Sweden just to name a few... Nevertheless my feet landed back home in Perth, to spend time with my family, friends and fur-babies while tending to my veggie garden, where the sun sets over the ocean, the air is fresh, the sun shines and life is holistically healthy.

As a child and a young adult my parents took a healthy approach to life, so _**fortunately the significance of health has been my foundation**_, now although I have always been aware of health it has not always been of such importance to me as it is now today and continues to be...!  
Like many I haven't always been as kind and nourishing to this body, mind and soul I was blessed with and in my younger years it would not have been strange to see me donning a glass of bubbles, while dancing up a storm into the early hours of the morning in a smoke laden venue... Now, don't get me wrong I wouldn't change a thing from the past as I have experienced, learnt and grown into who I am today, however I can say if I knew what I know now I would have perhaps been a little more _**patient, kinder, nourishing and loving**_ with myself.

In my late twenties I rediscovered health and was intrigued, using any spare time I had investigating, reading, studying and experimenting on myself (not much has really changed :) ) and my loved ones about different ways to easily incorporate health into everyday lifestyle.

Initially, physical exercise and nutrition - real organic nutrient dense food was and still are my inspiration and are extremely fascinating to me. However as I grow, I become increasing inspired and excited in mind-body connection, practicing mindfulness to become the best possible version of a holistically healthy you.  
The impact of balancing the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of self day to day and those we surround ourselves with has become necessary in understanding a greater depth holistic health, which lead me to study a diploma in [Kinesiology][0], a bachelor of health science in Naturopathy (currently studying) and also studying to become a **Certified Health Coach** through the [Institute of Integrative Nutrition][1].

I have always been interested in physical movement from a young child I practiced ballet and attended a specialist high school for dancing, I then went on to discover boxing for fitness. In my thirties I largely focused on boxing and strength & conditioning training, competing in an amateur boxing fight, I still continue to box as a form of mental stress release, it's like a form of meditation for me as I must remain extremely present in my mind and body. At the start of 2015 I set myself a new goal to cross off my bucket list to compete as a natural Fitness Competitor within the Body Building industry so I started body sculpting and still am to date placing in the INBA World Championships 2015 for;  
1st Fitness Model 30+   
2nd Fitness Model Open   
3rd Fitness Model Novice 

I currently have a raw treats business [**Love Live Nourish**][2] in which I supplies cafes in Perth with raw indulgent vegan chocolates and cakes along side teaching healthy food workshops.  
I am always experimenting in the kitchen, as I love celebrating life over delicious nutritious food- after all food is what brings families and people together to share our precious time and energy.

My wish and inspiration is finding a healthy balance that enriches your world, together we will find new and exciting ways to add more joy and health into your everyday life. This isn't always easy to do alone however through assistance and support I can challenge **_you_** to grow and evolve to be the best version of self possible.

**_'Assisting others in attaining their highest health potential through creating a balanced holistically healthy lifestyle just for them.'_**
